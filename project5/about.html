        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>

          I really enjoy getting outside in nature. Taking walks in the woods or parks help me de-stress. I love doing yoga and meditate every morning. I am a certified Reiki Master in Traditional Usui Healing.

 

          When I am not in nature, I like to play with my 4 cats. I previously had one cat and took in a stray. Aparently, the stray was pregnant and now I have a family of 4. I am huge animal lover and really enjoy spending time with my babies.

 

          I am a really creative person. I enjoy activities that involve problem solving and using your imagination. I could spend my whole day drawing in my sketch book or working on an acrylic painting.
